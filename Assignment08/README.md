# National Weather Service: Weather.gov
## Emily DiPressi 

### Introduction: 
My project focuses on weather.gov. This site has functions that range from basic weather searches for user's current location to more detailed information on weather safety features or phenomenal weather patterns. Upon first using this website, I was really frustrated with how inconsistent the different pages were from each other: different designs, text colors and sizes, and being taken to other webpages. Information that should have been presented in a clear way was not and it made it hard to read and understand. My goal with weather.gov was to streamline the design and make the information presented easier to read and to fill in the missing gaps that were on the original website. I designed with a wide variety of users in mind: users with colorblindness, users that needed information fast and not presented in a complicated manner, and users that are not as tech savvy as younger generations.

### Clear Design Statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
The National Weather Service website works in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They provide local and national weather forecasts along with detailed maps that contain other meteorological information on maps. They have past weather, safety, and educational material on their website. The National Weather Service website is not an easily navigable website, therefore, it is very easy to get lost in the web page. Since the website works with two corporations you never know where a link will take you. This does not make the user experience smooth or enjoyable. The designs change with almost every page change and those pages are also overwhelming with different information and designs. This website needs major improvements.

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing 
Through my heuristic evaluation I found that user control and freedom and consistency and standards were my top priorities to be fixed. I thought that they were the most frustrating parts of the website and were the most important to fix; they were top priority. Aesthetic and minimalist design is another function I thought would need improvements, but with the fixing of consistency and standards, I think that aesthetic and minimalist design would be improved through that.

### User Research:
The main activity that weather.gov supports for its users is to find the weather for a specific location and to find other important information surrounding the weather in an area. Are there important alerts happening: rainstorms, fire, or other natural phenomenons? This activity solves the users’ basic need for safety. Without knowing the right precautions needed to take for the day to protect against the elements, the user can be put in harm's way, such as needing sunscreen on a sunny day or a raincoat for when it rains. The user will navigate throughout the website, searching for their current location and see if they can find the helpful information from that page that they want, such as an hourly breakdown. For more advanced searches they will navigate to other areas of the website, such as “safety” and search for more detailed information such as UV index.

### UX Storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
UX storytelling is important in user design. It allows the creators to gain more insight into their product and how it is used. Creating personas helps creators imagine the user and what their needs are and how different users would use the product. Storytelling will help in the future for more functionality and ease of use.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]


### Low-fidelity Prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
This type of user research is very important. Mapping out exactly how a website will function is an integral step in creating a website that will be functional to the user. Low fidelity prototyping and wire flows are essential in testing how screens will work and how the user will use them. Getting in touch with the user and testing the flows brings up issues that may not have been noticed before, but now after observing how a viewer uses the screen can help improve usability.

### High-fidelity Prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
The high-fidelity prototype is the last step in this process of usability testing, user study, design, and low-fidelity prototyping. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to visually test how the website will look and function. It can test the color, size, placement, and overall organization of the webpage before being programmed as a live site. My high fidelity prototype is for weather.gov. The tasks that are functional on this prototype are searching for the hourly weather for a specific location, checking the drought conditions for a current location, and searching for fire watch/warning information, and to navigate back to the homepage.

### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
